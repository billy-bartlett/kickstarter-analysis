# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This analysis was performed to gain an understanding on how different Kickstarter campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. Multiple visuals are being provided to assist in the storytelling and provides you an opportunity to do a side-by-side comparison of the data. Fun!

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to identify trends in the data to help you make data-based decisions. You can leverage key insights from former Kickstarter campaigns to maximize the chances of launching a successful campaign! 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The chart above shows the number of campaigns (successful, failed, and canceled) by month. Different colors were used to differentiate between the different categories of campaigns. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The chart above shows the percentage of campaigns (successful, failed, and canceled) by goal range. Again, different colors were used to differentiate between the different categories of campaigns. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One challenge with this dataset is there are no canceled campaigns in the “play” category to consider. Having examples here would offer potential insight into why a campaign may have been cancelled and help you avoid making potential missteps. But have no fear, we have plenty of insight from successful and failed campaigns for you to consider!

The dataset included campaign information from multiple countries, parent categories, and subcategories. To ensure I provided the best possible insight, I filtered down to the data that most accurately resembled the campaign you are considering launching. Without taking this step, you wouldn’t have the most relevant data to consider and this can be a huge roadblock in your campaign’s succes!

Another potential issue I had to consider was the existence of outliers in the “theater” category and “play” subcategory. Outliers can skew data which leads to a false representation of what the data is telling us. Don’t fear the outlier! There are none present in the analysis you are reading.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Looking at the chart, you can see the best possible month to launch your campaign is May. May also has the highest number of failed campaigns but the percentage of successful campaigns to failed campaigns in May is higher than any other month. Launch in May!

If you can’t launch your campaign in May, the second best month to lauch is June. You will notice successful campaigns trend downward from May all the way through September. The farther out you push your campaign from May, the lower your odds of successfully hitting your campaign goal. There is a slight uptick in October but it’s much better to launch well before that if at all possible. 

Furthermore, try to avoid launching in January, March, September, November, and December if you can help it. These months have the lowest number of successful campaigns.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
You estimate a budget of $10,000+, with this in mind, the data shows you have a 50% chance of hitting your funding goal. While we’d love to have a higher number, lowering your budget to $5,000 only slightly increases your chance of a successful campaign. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
One limitation in this data set is the lack of recent campaigns. The latest campaign data I was able to analyze is from 2016. Having more recent data may closer reflect what you can expect in your campaign. We were still able to analyze over 300 campaigns in the “play” subcategory though so we had a good data set to work with.

Another limitation I ran into is that there were no cancelled campaigns for the “play” subcategory for me to analyze, as mentioned above. Having no cancelled campaigns is great news though!

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could take this analysis a bit further by pulling theater subcategory information into a chart to determine the percentage of “play” campaigns compared to “spaces” and “musicals.” This would give you an idea of how many other play campaigns you may be competing with for funding.

We could also run some analysis on the “play” subcategory by year to see how play campaigns fared year-by-year.

Enjoy!
